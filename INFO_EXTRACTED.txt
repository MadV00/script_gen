1. Dangers, Challenges & Interactions  
   
  A. Predator Behaviours & Tactics  
  • Quinkana (land croc) – hunted on open ground rather than lurking in rivers. Long legs and hoof-like toes allowed it to sprint down prey; blade-like, serrated teeth sliced through muscle in a single bite. Evidence suggests it could still swim, so no refuge in water.  
  • Megalania (giant monitor lizard) – ambush predator with powerful limbs and hooked claws for grasping or climbing. Razor-sharp, recurved teeth gripped flesh while venomous saliva (an anticoagulant) caused wounds to bleed and fester, leaving survivors weak or infected.  
  • Wonambi (giant constrictor snake) – lay in wait near water or game trails. Constricted victims to suffocation, then, unable to unhinge its jaws, used sharp teeth and crushing muscles to tear off large chunks of flesh or even disembowel prey.  
  • Thylacoleo carnifex (marsupial lion) – ambush specialist combining bone-crushing bite and retractable thumb claws. Incisor-like front teeth stabbed deeply; flattened premolars severed windpipe and spinal cord. Climbing adaptations let it drag kills into trees to avoid competition.  
   
  B. Survival Hurdles for Humans  
  • Waterholes – essential in dry seasons but hotspots for ambush by snakes, crocs, monitor lizards and large cats.  
  • Plant identification – distinguishing edible roots or seeds from toxic species under shifting climatic stress.  
  • Extreme droughts – forced movement into marginal habitats, increased encounters with concentrated megafauna and predators.  
  • Shelter – caves and rocky overhangs offered refuge but concealed unseen threats above or behind.  
   
  C. Human-Fauna Interactions  
  • Megafauna hunting – burned Genyornis eggshells in hearth deposits point to egg gathering; cut marks on bones of Diprotodon and other large herbivores suggest butchery with stone tools.  
  • Defensive fire – use of controlled burns and hearth smoke to deter predators at camp perimeters.  
  • Tracking & ambush – humans knew predator patterns around water and game trails, setting snares or spear traps.  
   
  D. Inter-Fauna Interactions  
  • Top-predator competition – Quinkana versus Megalania and Thylacoleo likely vied over kills; ambush sites near water may have attracted multiple species.  
  • Snake and lizard prey overlap – Wonambi and Megalania both hunted large herbivores, potentially scavenging each other’s kills or clashing at carcasses.  
   
  E. Key Events  
  • First human arrival (~60,000 years ago) introduced hunting pressure coinciding with rapid megafaunal declines.  
  • Repeated severe droughts compressed animal movements into predictable corridors and waterholes, intensifying predator–human encounters.  
  • Megafauna extinctions (≈45,000–18,000 years ago) reshaped the food web and human subsistence strategies.  
   
2. Key Fauna  
   
  • Quinkana (terrestrial crocodile) – about as long as a tall giraffe’s neck is high; long-legged croc with serrated, slicing teeth; apex land predator and capable swimmer.  
  • Megalania (Varanus priscus) – monitor lizard as long as a bus, yet beefier; razor teeth, venomous bite, powerful limbs and claws for slashing or climbing; ambush predator.  
  • Wonambi (giant snake) – constrictor rivaling the length of a small SUV; stiff-jawed, serrated teeth; crushed and shredded prey rather than swallowing whole.  
  • Thylacoleo carnifex (marsupial lion) – about a modern lioness’s size; muscle-packed build with bone-crushing bite and hooked, retractable thumb claws; arboreal ambush hunter.  
  • Diprotodon (giant wombat) – elephant-sized herbivore with tank-like frame and massive grinding teeth; could crush bone if defending itself; herd movement posed trampling risk.  
  • Genyornis newtonii (thunderbird) – flightless bird taller than a human; stout legs delivered crushing kicks, hooked beak and claws for defense; likely herbivorous but territorial.  
  • Giant short-faced kangaroo – walked upright like a heavyweight boxer; powerful hind limbs but mainly a browser.  
  • Palorchestes (marsupial tapir) – shaped like a pig with a small trunk; stood on hind legs using sloth-like claws to strip bark; unpredictable defensive strikes.  
   
3. Relevant People & Places  
   
  A. People/Hominids  
  • First Australians – arrived ≈60,000 years ago, developing tools, controlled fire and cooperative hunting to survive amidst megafauna.  
   
  B. Places  
  • Waterholes and riverbanks – predator ambush hotspots.  
  • Open plains and scrub – exposure to fast-running herbivores (kangaroos) and giant birds.  
  • Forested gullies and caves – refuge from heat but concealment zones for arboreal or cliff-dwelling predators.  
  • Drought refugia – rock shelters and dry watercourses where scarce resources attracted both humans and large animals.  
   
4. Supporting Concepts  
   
  A. Timelines & Periods  
  • Pleistocene (≈2.6 million–11,700 years ago) – era of Australian megafauna and human arrival.  
  • Megafauna extinction pulse (≈45,000–18,000 years ago) – overlapping with increasing human presence and climatic shifts.  
   
  B. Environmental Conditions  
  • Cyclical extreme droughts – forced concentration of wildlife and humans around shrinking water sources.  
  • Fire regime – natural and human-set fires defined landscape openings versus dense refuge areas.  
   
  C. Key Findings  
  • Burned Genyornis eggshells – direct evidence of human predation on giant bird eggs.  
  • Butchery marks on Diprotodon bones – humans processed large herbivores with stone implements.  
  • Footprint assemblages – paired human and megafauna tracks reveal pursuit or avoidance behaviour along dried lakebeds.
